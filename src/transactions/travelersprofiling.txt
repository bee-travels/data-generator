TIME, LUXURY, COMFORT, BUDGET

^^time used to be business, there was a mixup

IDEA: instead of family, do party size. Because family is only a separate category because it typically involves more people (and tend to be budget oriented in non-elite income levels)
Hotels
- Frequent 
    - 0.75(loyalty), 0.25 comfort
    - 0.6(loyalty), 0.4 budget
    - 0.5, 0.5 time (they will want convenience first but also security booking will work out) -- used to be business
    - 0.9(loyalty), 0.1 luxury
- Moderate
    - 0.5(loyalty), 0.5 luxury
    - 0.5, 0.5 comfort/family
    - 0.5, 0.5 time
    - 0.4, 0.6 budget
- Infrequent 
    - 0.2, 0.8 luxury 
    - 0.1, 0.9 budget
    - 0.25, 0.75 family
    - 0.4, 0.6 comfort 
    - 0.5, 0.5 time
Large Parties (>4)
    ? ==> are they more likely to take loyalty programs if needing multiple rooms at once
    ? exception is budget

Cars
    I think rental companies tend to be random and go by availability or experiences
    Maybe a loyalty program has a maximum of 5-10% influence on customers
- luxury
- budget


Flying
    Miles plays a role
- Frequent 
    - 0.8(loyalty), 0.2 comfort
    - 0.7(loyalty), 0.3 budget
    - 0.2, 0.8 time/family (family just need enough seats together)
    - 0.4(loyalty), 0.6 luxury (want first class but miles are nice)
- Moderate
    - 0.6 (loyalty), 0.4 luxury
    - 0.5, 0.5 comfort
    - 0.2, 0.8 family/time
    - 0.5, 0.5 budget
- Infrequent 
    - 0.3, 0.7 luxury 
    - 0.1, 0.9 budget
    - 0.2, 0.8 time/family
    - 0.4, 0.6 comfort 
WHAT IS CONSIDERED FREQUENT, MODERATE, INFREQUENT
our range is 

----Pseudo Code----
    user = {
        "name": fake.name(),
        "income": income,
        "address": fake.address(),
        "car_rental_loyalty": get_car_rental_company(),
        "hotel_chain_loyalty": get_hotel_chain(),
        "airlines_loyalty": get_airline(),
        "travel_frequency": get_travel_frequency(reason, income),
        "priority": get_priority(reason, income),
        "frequently_visited_cities": [],
        "marital_status": marital_status,
        "party_size": get_party_size(reason, marital_status),
        "main_reason_for_travel": reason
    }

users = lst of user

for x in range(len(users)-1):
    priority = users[x]["priority"]
    main_reason = users[x]["main_reason_for_travel"]
    #possibly party size matters -- an extra level of complexity to think of
    frequency = users[x]["travel_frequency"]
